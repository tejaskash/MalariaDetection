# Deep Learning For Medical Images
Using Deep Learning to detect malaria in thin blood smears. Through this repository you can learn how to train your own machine learning model using keras and tensorflow to detect malaria in images of blood semars.

Malaria is a disease caused by the plasmodium parasite, which is a vector borne disease transmitted by the anopheles mosquito.
